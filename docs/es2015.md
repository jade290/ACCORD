# ES2015

- - - -

**ES2015** or **ES6** or **ECMAScript 6** or **ECMAScript 2015**,
whatever you choose to call it, here are some resources to help you
understand it:

The [Official Specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) is long and technical and verbose and very, very official.  I don't recommend starting here, because it's a little 'information-overload-y'.  You might be in to that sort of thing, though.  I'm not judging.

The [ES6 Features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#readme) GitHub repo is a nice place to start.  It's a pretty concise summary of the
syntax differences between ES5 and ES6, and includes easy-to-follow code snippets of the syntax in action.

[Codeburst.io](https://codeburst.io/es6-tutorial-for-beginners-5f3c4e7960be) has a nice ES6 tutorial for beginners, as well.
